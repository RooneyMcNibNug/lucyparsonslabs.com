teaser: "According to a recent DOJ report, CPD was using a 35 year old video on the use of deadly force by officers. Included in that report was a suggestion that one CPD recruit 'appeared to be sleeping' which prompted us to FOIA for the video."

The Lucy Parsons Labs, with other partners, began annotating the Department of Justice report about the Chicago Police Department. In the report, the DOJ found ["CPD engages in a pattern or practice of force in violation of the Constitution"](https://www.justice.gov/opa/file/925846/download). Included in that report was instances of racism, police kidnapping people and dropping them off in rival gang neighborhoods and a widespread pattern of failing to investigate police misconduct. Further in the report the Department of Justice visited a class on the use of force and found: "As just one example, a class we observed on deadly force involved officers viewing a video made roughly 35 years ago, prior to key Supreme Court decisions that altered the standards used to evaluate the reasonableness of use of force. The tactics depicted in the video were clearly out of date with commonly accepted police standards of today. Following the video, the instructor spoke for approximately thirty minutes, but did not give detailed information on justified versus unjustified use of deadly force or the standard of objective reasonableness — all essential topics for deadly force training. The training itself was inconsistent with CPD’s force policies, further undermining its utility in teaching recruits their obligations under Department policy and constitutional law."

So naturally we [FOIAed](https://www.muckrock.com/foi/chicago-169/chicago-police-training-video-31943/?#comms) the Chicago Police Deparment for the video. Curiously, CPD's FOIA officer claimed the video was exempt from disclosure because of the Federal Copyright Act of 1976.  The video, which came out in 1982 was however available for purchase on the Internet. After some discussions in our Slack Channel, someone was able to locate the video on the [Intenet Archive](https://archive.org/details/shootdontshoot). We had begun discussions about suing for the video under Illinois FOIA law because we believe that the video falls under the "Fair Use" exemption of the Copyright Act. However, because it is readily available for download, we dropped this prospect. We hope you review the video for yourself.
