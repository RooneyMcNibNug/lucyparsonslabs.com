Lucy Parsons Labs strongly opposes the harassment and oppression of
those arrested during the #DisruptJ20 resistance to the Donald Trump inauguration.

[Dane Powell](http://www.unicornriot.ninja/?p=16954) was this week
sentenced to four months in federal prison for participating in a protest.
The remaining defendants face 75-80 years in federal prison, all for participating
in protest action.

DC police detained
journalists, legal observers as well as protestors during the J20 protests.
DC police are [being sued](https://www.buzzfeed.com/zoetillman/the-aclu-is-suing-dc-police-over-inauguration-day-arrests)
by ACLU for using excessive force and making unlawful arrests. 

We encourage our supporters to donate to defray the legal costs for the [J20
defendants here](http://defendj20resistance.org/support#statement).
