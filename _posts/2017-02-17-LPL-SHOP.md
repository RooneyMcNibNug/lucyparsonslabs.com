Starting today, official Lucy Parsons Labs merchandise is available on [our new on-line shop](https://lucyparsonslabs.bigcartel.com/)! All proceeds go directly to funding our projects and help cover costs like web hosting and legal fees. We have two items for sale, the first is a great poster that is printed on heavy poster stock with great color contrasts and printed with union labour right here in Chicago! The second item is a great sticker pack designed by one of our awesome volunteers! The stickers are printed on heavy outdoor vinyl and look great on laptops or cop cars!

This is just the start, look out for buttons and more stickers in the near future!
