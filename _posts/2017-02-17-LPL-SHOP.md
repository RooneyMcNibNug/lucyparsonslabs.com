Starting today, official Lucy Parsons Labs merchandise is available on [our new on-line shop](https://lucyparsonslabs.bigcartel.com/)! All proceeds go directly to funding our projects and help cover costs like web hosting and legal fees. We have two items for sale. The first is a sweet poster printed on heavy stock with great colors, printed by a union shop right here in Chicago! The second item is a sticker pack designed by one of our awesome volunteers. The stickers are printed on heavy outdoor vinyl and look great on laptops or cop cars!

This is just the start, look out for buttons and more stickers in the near future!
