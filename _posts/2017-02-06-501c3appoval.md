Lucy Parsons Labs is happy to announce that we obtained 501c3, non-profit status last week! While this will not change our core mission, it will clear the way for LPL to more easily raise funds and maintain bank accounts. It will also make it easier to obtain services as a non-profit from other groups. Most importantly, all donations to Lucy Parsons Labs will now be tax-deductible. Finally, the Lucy Parsons Labs wishes to thank our attorney, Dan Massoglia, for his help on this endeavor. Thank you Dan!
