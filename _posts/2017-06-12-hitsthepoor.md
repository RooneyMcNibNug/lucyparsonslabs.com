teaser: "A new report by Reason based on documents obtained by Lucy Parsons Labs shows that civil asset forfeiture primarily targets the poor. Our documents are an archive directly from the State's Attorney's office which include all money seized with amounts, their exact GPS location, as well as cars, electronics and miscellaneous amounts seized. It is a follow-up on a previous investigation by Lucy Parsons Labs, Joel Handley and the Chicago Reader."

This week, *Reason* published an article titled "Poor Neighborhoods Hit Hardest by Asset Forfeiture in Chicago, Data Shows". Based on documents provided by Lucy Parsons Labs, *Reason* analyzed over [23,000 civil asset forfeitures](http://reason.com/blog/2017/06/13/poor-neighborhoods-hit-hardest-by-asset) over the past five years. These documents are the result of many months of LPL investigating the demographics of civil asset forfeiture after [our larger investigation with Joel Handley](https://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/police-department-civil-forfeiture-investigation/Content?oid=23728922) in the *Chicago Reader*.

In a statement to *Reason*, Lucy Parsons Labs writes:

<blockquote>
"This data shows what we already know, that the seizures tried by CCSAO [Cook County State's Attorney Office] overwhelmingly steal the possessions of poor people. The data shows that the seizures are clumped in the South and West side, in overwhelmingly African-American neighborhoods. This provides more evidence that the war on drugs is a racist policy that must be ended."
</blockquote>

We believe these investigations provide further support for SB 689: [the Seizure and Forfeiture Reporting Act in Illinois](/legislation/Seizure-And-Forfeiture-Act/). The Lab has come to find out that local police forces are pushing back on this bill, which provides even **more reasons for adopting it** and we should resist efforts to make it less effective. We invite you to [explore the data yourself](https://github.com/lucyparsons/1505-documents/tree/master/CCSAO/CCSAO%20Seizure%20Data) and also read Radley Balko's [Op-Ed in the Washington Post.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-watch/wp/2017/06/13/chicago-civil-asset-forfeiture-hits-poor-people-the-hardest/)
