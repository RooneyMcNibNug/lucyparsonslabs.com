When Garry McCarthy was in charge of the Chicago Police, Chicago had the most intense stop-and-frisk program in the nation—[four times the rate that New York](
http://www.aclu-il.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/ACLU_StopandFrisk_6.pdf) did at the height of its stop-and-frisk program. Gathering the raw data has been a contentious issue among Chicago activists. As part of a larger campaign, [We Charge Genocide](http://wechargegenocide.org), a group of young black activists worked to compile a report of Chicago Police's pattern of abuses. As part of their efforts they worked to gather information such as Taser use, misconduct settlements and police stops.

During their advocacy efforts, We Charge Genocide attempted to introduce a bill in the City Council that would dramatically curtail the ability of CPD to conduct stops. Right before the bill was to be introduced, the City announced that they would enter into a [private agreement](http://www.truth-out.org/news/item/32361-aclu-of-illinois-sells-out-chicago-s-black-youth) with the ACLU of Illinois around stop and frisk. One of the conditions was that the ACLU would not [release the data](http://wechargegenocide.org/an-open-letter-to-the-aclu-of-illinois-regarding-stop-frisk/) given to them and that a retired judge would oversee the private agreement.

After the Department of Justice completed their report into Chicago Police they found a pattern of [abusive practices](https://www.theatlantic.com/news/archive/2017/01/justice-department-chicago-police-report/513113/) including shooting individuals who posed no risk to officers, widespread and systemic racism, and unlawful use of Tasers. After the DOJ report was completed, we sent a request for an ["index" of requested documents](https://www.muckrock.com/foi/chicago-169/city-hall-all-doj-documents-32678/) to the City's Law office:

> Pursuant to the Illinois Freedom of Information Act (5 ILCS 140/1 to 11), I hereby request the following records:

> According to a recent report from the Department of Justice on CPD's Use of Force:

> "First, we reviewed thousands of pages of documents provided to us by CPD, IPRA, and the City, including policies, procedures, training plans, Department orders and memos, internal and external reports, and more". Therefore, I am any any index listing record provided to the DOJ as part of the civil rights investigation. Also I am requesting a copies of all requests for records issued by the DOJ.

> The requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes. Please be aware that this request is being filed by the Lucy Parsons Labs, a registered non-profit in the state of IL.



The DOJ requested a number of records including documents related to the use of force and police discipline. In one page they described  [requesting contact cards](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4443649-2016-11-14-Ltr-From-LG-to-Taft-Re-USDOJ-Seventh.html#document/p3/a419234). A contact card is a card that a CPD officer is required to fill out after a stop-and-frisk. The DOJ even mentions that the main database used by CPD (CLEAR) contains the records we are interested in.

>  The CLEAR description of the “contact_cards” table indicates that it is the “[m]ain record for a contact card or traffic safety stop.” The CLEAR description of the “contact_traffic_stops” table indicates that it “[s]tores additional fields relating to contact cards of source Traffic Stop.”

That information was sufficient for us to send [two](https://www.muckrock.com/foi/chicago-169/cpd-contact-cards-2012-2014-38540/) [requests](https://www.muckrock.com/foi/chicago-169/cpd-contact-cards-2014-2016-34241/) and we finally obtain over six years of data. Today we are releasing the full data set as part of the [Chicago Data Collaborative](https://chicagodatacollaborative.org/). We have uploaded [preliminary](https://dataforjustice.github.io/chicagostopandfrisk/) [analysis](https://github.com/DataForJustice/chicagostopandfrisk) on GitHub. The original documents are also available for [download](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/f1aa18osfmdcary/AAC4WnzTpbKz9sjT1pik04vwa?dl=0) In particular, Lucy Parsons Labs owes a deep debt to [Paola Villarreal](https://twitter.com/paw) for volunteering her time and skills to analyze the data and publish the preliminary analysis.
