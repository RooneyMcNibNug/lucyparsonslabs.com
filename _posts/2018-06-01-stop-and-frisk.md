During Garry McCarthy's time as Police Superintendent, Chicago had the most intense stop-and-frisk program in the nation—performing stops at a rate [four times greater than New York's](https://www.aclu-il.org/sites/default/files/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/ACLU_StopandFrisk_6.pdf) at the height of its infamous stop-and-frisk program.

Obtaining data on this practice has long been a priority for Chicago activists and community advocates. But this has proved difficult. As part of the [We Charge Genocide](http://wechargegenocide.org) campaign, a group of young black activists worked to compile a report on the Chicago Police's pattern of abuses. They investigated Taser use, misconduct settlements, police stops, and more.

During their efforts, We Charge Genocide attempted to introduce a bill in the Chicago City Council that would severely restrict the CPD's ability to conduct stops. Before that bill could be introduced, the City announced it would enter into a [private agreement](http://www.truth-out.org/news/item/32361-aclu-of-illinois-sells-out-chicago-s-black-youth) with the ACLU of Illinois regarding stop and frisk. One condition of that agreement was that the ACLU *would not* [release the data](http://wechargegenocide.org/an-open-letter-to-the-aclu-of-illinois-regarding-stop-frisk/) they had obtained on stop-and-frisk.

The Department of Justice's 2015--2016 investigation of the Chicago Police found a pattern of [abusive practices](https://www.theatlantic.com/news/archive/2017/01/justice-department-chicago-police-report/513113/): shooting people who posed no risk to officers, widespread and systemic racism, and unlawful use of Tasers, among others. After the DOJ [report](https://www.justice.gov/opa/file/925846/download) was released, LPL filed a public records request with the City for an ["index" of documents requested by the DOJ ](https://www.muckrock.com/foi/chicago-169/city-hall-all-doj-documents-32678/) . That request showed that the thousands of pages of police records reviewed by the DOJ included so-called "[contact cards](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4443649-2016-11-14-Ltr-From-LG-to-Taft-Re-USDOJ-Seventh.html#document/p3/a419234)"---forms that CPD officers are required to fill out after every stop-and-frisk. According to the DOJ,

> The CLEAR description of the “contact cards” table indicates that it is the “[m]ain record for a contact card or traffic safety stop.” The CLEAR description of the “contact_traffic_stops” table indicates that it “[s]tores additional fields relating to contact cards of source Traffic Stop.”

Based on this information, Lucy Parsons Labs was able to send [two](https://www.muckrock.com/foi/chicago-169/cpd-contact-cards-2012-2014-38540/) more specific [requests](https://www.muckrock.com/foi/chicago-169/cpd-contact-cards-2014-2016-34241/) and finally obtain over six years of data.

Today we are releasing the full data set as part of the [Chicago Data Collaborative](https://chicagodatacollaborative.org/). We have also made available some preliminary [data visualizations](https://dataforjustice.github.io/chicagostopandfrisk/) and an [open-source](https://github.com/DataForJustice/chicagostopandfrisk) analysis. The original documents are available for [download](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/lq4uvm5bb2ikur7/AAB4AuGpbTvHFcMP8xq4rfsJa?dl=0).

Lucy Parsons Labs owes a deep debt to [Paola Villarreal](https://twitter.com/paw) for volunteering her time and effort to analyze the data and publishing the preliminary visualizations.
