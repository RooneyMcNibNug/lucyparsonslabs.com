Lucy Parsons Labs is committed to the free flow of information about policies that directly affect our city and our communities. These issues are not always easy to see. . (See [http://projects.washingtonpost.com/top-secret-america/articles/monitoring-america/](Top Secret America))

On February 16, 2017, we filed a request under the Freedom of Information Act for SOMETHING.

We are therefore seeking a court to order the CPD to release these records.

We [https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B58bynYpgF_aVlJyRHBESTQ1MF9jTHBTWWZTV3d5TUpvbHVB/](filed suit) against CPD for records on Suspicious Activity Reports and Fusion Center audits.

What we call a *willfull violation* of the law.
