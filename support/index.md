------------------------
The Lucy Parsons Labs is the process of registering as a 501c3 non-profit. At the moment, we are entirely self-funded but support would be accepted. We have established a bitcoin wallet at [1JEwcx2gK5GYpFC1SAeXBCTX9mj2MjqSdE](https://blockchain.info/address/1JEwcx2gK5GYpFC1SAeXBCTX9mj2MjqSdE).
