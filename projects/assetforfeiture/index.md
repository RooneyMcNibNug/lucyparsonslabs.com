Since 2015, Lucy Parsons Labs has been investigating the use of civil asset forfeiture by
the Chicago Police Department (CPD), the Cook County State's Attorney's Office, and
the State of Illinois.

Civil asset forfeiture is a process by which police and prosecutors keep cash, cars, and
other valuables from people after seizing the property during a traffic stop, an arrest, or
an investigation. In Illinois, as in many states across the country, the state does not need
to convict the person of a crime, or even to bring charges against them, before
maneuvering to keep the person's property.

Before we began investigating CPD's use of civil forfeiture, no one knew how much
money the department made through the process or how it spent its secret income. After
numerous FOIA requests and lawsuits, Lucy Parsons Labs—in collaboration with
Muckrock, independent journalist Joel Handley, and the Chicago Reader—liberated the
full record of CPD's forfeiture income and expenditures, from 2009 through 2015.
For the first time, Chicagoans could see that CPD took between $4 million and $9 million
from citizens every year. Free of any outside oversight, CPD used this money to wage its
daily war on drugs—through routine payments for police vehicles, computers, and cell
phones—and to purchase controversial surveillance equipment like Stingray cell-phone
tracking equipment, Automatic License Plate Readers, and PENLink equipment, all
without any public record.

Separately, Lucy Parsons Labs analyzed more than [23,000 civil asset foreitures](https://lucyparsonslabs.com/journalism/HitsThePoor/) within
Cook County and determined that the vast majority took place in the parts of Chicago and
the county that are already the most heavily policed: poor, predominantly black and
brown neighborhoods on the city's South and West Sides. This work was cited by the
[Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-watch/wp/2017/06/13/chicago-civil-asset-forfeiture-hits-poor-people-the-hardest/?utm_term=.a89dc128f535) and [Reason](http://reason.com/blog/2017/06/13/poor-neighborhoods-hit-hardest-by-asset) as evidence of discriminatory policing.

Muckrock and how we conducted the investigation [here](https://www.chicagoreader.com/Bleader/archives/2016/09/29/how-we-pulled-back-the-curtain-on-cpds-secret-spending). And you can peruse our
[searchable database](https://lucyparsonslabs.com/fullaudit/) of the more than 560 checks we obtained from CPD.

Following our investigation, there were calls for reform in the [Chicago City Council](https://www.chicagoreader.com/Bleader/archives/2016/10/03/city-hall-reacts-to-reader-revelations-about-the-chicago-police-departments-secret-budget) and
the Illinois legislature. While city leaders expressed concern that the police department
was able to use forfeiture money at its own discretion, and had hidden the funds from the
City Council and the mayor's office, there have so far been no proposals to change the
practice within the city government.

However, in September, Illinois adopted a new law titled the Seizure and Forfeiture
Reporting Act, which will bring some reforms to the process beginning in January 2018.
(In a letter supporting the reform bill, Cook County State's Attorney Kim Foxx cited [our
research](https://lucyparsonslabs.com/journalism/CivilAssetForfeitureReform/).) The most important changes will be that CPD and other law enforcement
agencies across the state will need to report publicly the money they make and spend
through civil forfeiture; that small amounts of marijuana can no longer justify the seizure
and forfeiture of cash or other assets, less than $500; and that the
burden of proof will be on the state, as opposed to the victim. (Currently, the state only
needs to prove that police and prosecutors have probable cause that the asset was
connected to a crime, while a person seeking to get their property back needs to meet the
higher standard of preponderance of evidence to prove they were in possession of the
property legally.)

Lucy Parsons Labs supported [a previous effort](https://lucyparsonslabs.com/legislation/Seizure-And-Forfeiture-Act/) to reform civil forfeiture in Illinois that
would have been significantly stronger—forcing the state to convict a person of a crime
before being able to forfeit their property and pooling all of the forfeited assets into an
account run by the state. As it stands, even after the Seizure and Forfeiture Reporting Act
takes effect, people in Illinois can still lose their cash, cars, or other assets without ever
being convicted of a crime. Prosecutors will still only have to meet a low legal standard
to justify forfeiture. And individual police departments like CPD will be able to use
forfeiture money in any way they see fit. While LPL is happy to see that its work has helped bring some changes to the civil forfeiture process, there is still much work to be
done.
