### Who We Are
The Lucy Parsons Labs is a Chicago-based collaboration between data scientists, transparency activists, and technologists focusing on the intersection of digital rights and on-the-streets issues. The core group is made up of data scientists, sysadmins, and activists with a shared goal of merging these issues into a functional non-profit.

### What We Do
Our members are always working on a variety of projects and collaborations. Some examples include open FOIA projects into police spending, data analysis projects in Python, and presentations at hacker conferences. We also support the Tor network, give activist trainings on security culture, and enjoy mixing with journalists.

### Our Mission
We are a transparency non-profit that seeks to engage our community in a horizontal manner while organizing around digital rights issues, supporting free and open source projects, and seeking the free flow of information globally.
