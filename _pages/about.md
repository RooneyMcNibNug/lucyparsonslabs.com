### Who We Are

Lucy Parsons Labs is a collaboration between data scientists, transparency activists, artists, & technologists that operates in Chicago and the San Francisco Bay Area. We work at the intersection of digital rights and on-the-streets issues. Our main lines of work include providing digital security trainings, pursuing police accountability, researching the use of civil asset forfeiture, and filing public records requests.

### What We Do

Lucy Parsons Labsâ€™ energies are dedicated to:

 + offering digital security trainings for activists and at-risk communities;
 + maintaining a secure system for whistleblowers to report misconduct via SecureDrop;
 + developing an open-source police misconduct reporting tool, OpenOversight;
 + reforming civil asset forfeiture programs, which incentivize heavy-handed policing;
 + filing public records requests under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) and local equivalents.

Lucy Parsons Labs is a registered 501(c)(3) non-profit.
